There are long-held desires in life, but they don't always come true easily. For that, one must seek God's blessings. Something similar happened to me. For the past three years, I had been wanting to visit #Kolhapur, but the right time never came.

Finally, the day arrived. A friend and I, along with two bike, set off for Kolhapur. Upon reaching, we visited Maharaj's Panhala Fort and had the darshan of #Jyotiba.

Just like the song says, " भल्या उंच डोंगरात देवा तुझा वास र मर्जी तुझ्या भक्तावरी देवा तुझी खास र ," I felt truly blessed after having Jyotiba’s darshan. Later, we returned to our room, rested for a while, and then went to seek the blessings of Mother #Ambabai.

For three years, I had longed for this moment—to perform Aarti in the temple of Ambabai. Finally, my wish came true. My heart overflowed with joy as I saw my mother, tears welling up in my eyes. Witnessing Ambabai's Aarti was a deeply emotional experience.

Before leaving, we took a moment to express our gratitude, apologizing for our shortcomings, and sharing our new hopes and aspirations with her. Then, we headed to Rankala Lake, where we sat for a while, watched a match, and pondered over what to have for #dinner. Since we were in Kolhapur, it would have felt incomplete without tasting the famous तांबडा पांढरा रस्सा So, we indulged in a delicious non-vegetarian meal. The spicy chicken and mutton भाकरी  were truly satisfying. After dinner, we returned to our room and rested for the night.

The next morning, we woke up early and traveled to Kopeshwar Temple for darshan. The divine energy of the place was mesmerizing. We also explored the temple’s grand assembly hall, admiring its architectural beauty.

While standing there, one thought struck me—if it weren’t for our great ruler, #Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, we might never have been able to witness the grandeur of the Deccan. Blessed is that king, and blessed are his people.

With that thought in mind, our return journey began, carrying with us cherished memories of our spiritual and #cultural experience in Kolhapur.# Kolhapur-bike-ride-
